# Lane-Detection

**Problem Statement**

In this project, the aim was to do simple Lane Detection to mimic Lane Departure Warning systems used in Self Driving Cars. Videos from a driving car were given and the job was to extract frames from the videos, do lane detection using image processing techniques, and give a video with detected lanes as the output.

**Running the Code**

Simply run *Project_1.m* with the input as the filename of the video to be analyzed.

**Result**

The result is the video with the lanes detected. It also detects the turn.
